## Peanute Brittle
Sweet, but not sticky. Kind of buttery, never greasy. Hard, but not tough. Thin and translucent. Aromatic, infused with the flavor of roasted peanuts. These are the qualities of unforgettable peanut brittle. Unfortunately, much of the commercially-produced peanut brittle is less memorable than a tray of ballpark nachos. Here we share with you our recipe and techniques for making classic peanut brittle — the kind that will have your friends and family begging for mre.

## Ingredients
* 1 cup corn syrup
* 2 cups sugar
* ½ cup water
* 2 cups raw, Spanish peanuts
* 1½ teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* ¾ teaspoon baking soda
* 1½ tablespoons butter

## Preparation
Use a fairly heavy, 2½–3 quart saucepan. Stainless steel with a coppe-clad bottom is ideal. Do not use an all-aluminium pan. You will likely get “hot spots” which cause burning before you know it. Place corn syrup and water into the pan over medium-high heat.
After it warms up, but before it begins to boil, stir in the sugar. Bring to full boil, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon. Insert candy thermometer after a few minutes. When the temperature reahes 250 degrees Farenheit, add the peanuts and salt and stir.

Bring the mixture back to a full boil. Now, in this phase, the correct amount of stirring is of critical importance. Constant stirring can prevent the browning that is required both for flavor and appearance. Under-stirring will cause the peanutson the bottom of the pan to burn, and may cause the syrup to burn at the sides of the pan. It takes practice to neither under- nor over-stir the candy as it cooks. Don’t let your fear of burning prevent you from browning. Without browning, your peanut brittle will be pale in color and lacking in toasty flavor. Some manufacturers add caramel color, which doesn’t help the flavor. Properly cooked, the candy will develop the rich golden-brown color seen in pictures, without the addition of coloring agents.

When the temperature reahes 305 degrees Farenheit, remove the pan from the heat immediately. Do not let it go above 305 degrees, or the finished produt may develop a weak, spongy structure. Immediately after removing the pan from the heat, add the butter and vanilla extract, and stir *(carefully—it’s hot!)* until the butter is melted.
Sprinkle the baking soda over the surface of the mixture and stir. The mixture will begin to foam up and double in volume

Now you need a clean, smooth, flat surface to pour the mixture onto. A marble pastry board is ideal, as the marble allows the candy to cool slowly enough so you have time to stretch it before it hardens. You may use a large baking sheet, but you will have to wor quickly because the candy will cool and harden more rapidly. Prepare the surface ahead of time by coating it with butter or non-stick cooking spray. Immediately after stirring the baking soda, pour the hot mixture onto the surface. Don’t try to spread the mixture too much with the wooden spoon; you will end up scraping the peanuts into one place. Instead, put on a pair of cotton gloves, and put a pair of plastic food-handling gloves over the cotton gloves. Coat the plastic gloves with butter, paying special attention to the fingers.

Now, use a spatula to loosen the candy from the cooling surface, then pick it up and flip it over. Keep in mind that the candy is still very hot, and can melt the plastic gloves, so try to use a light touch, and handle the candy by the outside edges, which cool more rapidly. Flipping reduces the surface contact and allows for easier stretching of the solidifying mass. Stretch until the candy becomes thin but without too many holes. The edges may have to be broken to allow them to stretch to the desired thinness.

Once stretched, leave the candy alone to cool, which will take a couple of hours. After cooling, the peanut brittle can be broken up by hand or by whacking it with the handles of a butter knife *(watch out fo flying pieces.)* Store the peanut brittle in airtight containers. If you use plastic bags, you may want to double bag it. The candy can have some sharp edges that tend to poke through.
