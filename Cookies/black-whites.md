# Black and Whites

## Ingredients
* 2 cups chocolate chips
* ¾ cup butter (1½ sticks)
* 2 cups brown sugar (*or white sugar with a sant 2 tablespoons molasses mixed in)
* 4 eggs
* 2 teaspoons vanilla
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 2 cups flour
* approx. ½ cup confectioner’s sugar (aka *powdered sugar*) in a small bowl

## Preparation
Melt chocolate chips with butter. *(Microwave on high power for 2 minutes, then stir until smooth.)

Mix in sugar and let cool. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Mix in vanilla, baking powder, and salt. Add flour and mix well.

Chill dough for a least 4 hours. *(Overnight is even better.)*

## Baking
When you’re ready to bake, preheat the oven to 350 degrees Farenheit, rack in the middle position.

Roll walnut-sized dough balls with your hands. *(Messy—wear plastic gloves if you wish.)* Drop the dough balls into a bowl with the powdered sugar and roll them around until they’re coated. *(If the dough gets too warm, stick it back in the refridgerator until you can handle it again.)

Place the balls on a greased cookie sheet, 12 to a standard sheet. *(They will flatten when they bake.)* Bake at 350 degrees Farenheit for 12–14 minutes. Let them cool on the cookie sheet for 2 minutes and then remove to wire/cooling rack to finish cooling.
