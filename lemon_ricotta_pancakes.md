# Lemon-Ricotta Pancakes
This recipe originally came from the Four Seasons Hotel on the Big Island, Hawai. We've tweaked the amount of lemon zest and changed the measurements from cups to weights because it ensures a much more consistent result than using cups. Notably, older flour is much more dense —so “heavier”— than a newer bag of flour. So if you’re going to use cups, **sift** the flour first.

## Ingredients
* 210g (1 ½ cups) all-purpose flour
* 35g (2 tablespoons) sugar
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* ½ teaspoon salt
* 1 ½ cups buttermilk
* 2 large eggs, separated
* 1 ½ tablespoon grated lemon peel (about 3 lemons)
* 85g (⅓ cup) part-skim ricotta cheese
  * *Often the part-skim only comes in large tubs. If you don’t want to waste, use full-fat ricotta.*

## Preparation
1. In a large bowl, mix flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt. In a medium bowl, whisk buttermilk, egg yolks, and lemon peel to blend. Stir buttermilk mixture into flour mixture just until evenly moistened. Gently stir in ricotta cheese.
2. In a bowl, with a mixer on high speed, beat the egg whites until soft peaks form. With a flexible spatula, gently fold the whites into the batter just until they are incorporated.
3. Place a nonstick griddle or a 12-inch nonstick frying pan over medium heat (350°); when hot, coat lightly with oil and adjust heat to maintain temperature. Drop batter in ½-cup (use a metal ladel; right volume and easy to pour) portions onto the griddle and cook until pancakes are browned on the bottom and edges begin to look dry, about 2 minutes; turn cakes with a wide spatula and brown other sides, 1 ½ to 2 minutes longer. Coat pan with more oil as necessary to cook remaining pancakes.
4. Serve pancakes as cooked, or keep warm in a single layer on baking sheets in a 200° oven for up to 15 minutes.

### Notes
We use an electric griddle because a) it helps cook like 5+ pancakes at once so you cook the lot way faster and b) you simply set the thermostat to 350 degrees, no guessing game and adjustinf the gas stove constantly.
One more thing: do **NOT** use Pam on a non-stick griddle. It leaves a crazy sticky mess. Instead, use canola oil and spread it evenly with a paper towel or a silicone brush.
